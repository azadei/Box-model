            <i>Since the rise of the Roman Empire, Italian art, architecture, and culture have had an influence around the world. Famed
                Italian painters include Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Italy is also at the heart of the Catholic Church, which is
                governed from Vatican City, a city-state surrounded by Rome. The family is at the center of Italian society. Young
                people often live at home until they are in their 30s, even if they have a job. When parents retire, they often go to
                live with their children.</i>

            Cuba is a place of perseverance. Discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492, it was colonized by Spain. The U.S. claimed
            Cuba during the Spanish-American War in 1898. However, in 1902, the island gained its independence. During the Cuban
            Revolution between 1953 and 1959, Fidel Castro replaced U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. Castro declared Cuba a
            socialist state in 1961. He remained in power until he became ill in 2008 and relinquished governmental control to his
            brother, Raul. The Communist Party of Cuba is the countryâ€™s governing political body. Following a Marxist-Leninist
            model, it is committed to socialism.
